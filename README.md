# üßπ SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìã Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data using SQL. The goal is to ensure the dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for analysis or visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
is the process of analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods and descriptive statistics. It serves as a crucial first step in the data analysis pipeline, enabling data scientists and analysts to better understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data before applying any formal modeling techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **SQL ( MySQL /)** ‚Äì core language for data cleaning
- **DBMS**: [SQL]


---

## üßΩ Cleaning Techniques Applied

- Removing duplicate records
- Handling NULL/missing values
- Standardizing date formats
- Fixing inconsistent category values (e.g., "USA" vs "United States")
- Data type conversions
- Filtering out irrelevant data

---

## üîÑ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-data-cleaning.git
   cd sql-data-cleaning
   ```

2. Set up your database and import the raw data.

3. Run the SQL scripts in the `scripts/` directory in order:
   ```sql
   \i scripts/step1_remove_nulls.sql
   \i scripts/step2_standardize_dates.sql
   -- and so on...
   ```

4. Cleaned data will be available in your target schema/table or in exported CSV files.
