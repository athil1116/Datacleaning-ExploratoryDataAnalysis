# üßπ SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìã Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data using SQL. The goal is to ensure the dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for analysis or visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
is the process of analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods and descriptive statistics. It serves as a crucial first step in the data analysis pipeline, enabling data scientists and analysts to better understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data before applying any formal modeling techniques.

# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì [Layoffs staging 2]

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the **[Layoffs staging 2]** dataset. This project focuses on understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset through visualization and statistical summaries.

## üîç Project Overview

The primary goal of this EDA is to:
- Understand the data distribution
- Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values
- Detect outliers or anomalies
- Explore relationships between features
- Prepare insights for potential modeling or further analysis
